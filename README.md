# Bridging Synthetic and Real-World Graph Scenarios via Integer Programming
### A Spatial Optimization Perspective on the Signed Double Roman Domination Problem

This repository contains benchmark instances and raw experimental results for three integer linear programming (ILP) models developed to solve the **Signed Double Roman Domination (SDRD)** problem.

This repository accompanies the research paper:
